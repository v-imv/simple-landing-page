# Simple Landing Page

This is a project I am undertaking to apply what I have learned about HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Git, Github and the Xubuntu (Linux Distribution) Terminal thus far in my journey of learning to code. In hindsight it is designed very poorly, I used a lot of padding and margin amd the page is not very responsive.
