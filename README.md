# Simple Landing Page
This is my first attempt at making a simple but modern looking landing page.

You can see how it looks by clicking on "github-pages" under the heading "Environments".

## Purpose Of This Project
I undertook this small project to try and apply:

-Basic Terminal Commands on the Xubuntu Linux Distribution

-How to use Git and Github

-Basic HTML
